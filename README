Apmgr

What was Apmgr?
===============

Apmgr was a real estate application written in PHP, using Zend Framework.
It was the year 2008, and I felt like I needed to start playing with Php Frameworks more seriously.
I tried for a bit Zend, but I found it a bit difficult, I tested another frameworks but they were
just awful.

Long story short, a year went by, and I decided to join efforts with another developer and create our own application and sell it.

Well, writting the application, learning the framework, was a difficult task, mostly because I had to work and so did she.

Also having a life was somewhat troublesome for the whole energy required to do this kind of thing.

You will find several tools that I used here, mostly handmade, from regular shellscripts, there must be something
that can be rehused here and there, I guess. I haven't touch this since 2011.

TL;DR;
It just didn't work out, she didn't knew at all how to sell the product (or actually wanted to go on with this), and I was an insistent asshole.
So it just didn't work.

If you want to take out something, just feel free to contact me and I will take it down (*if you actually wrote it*), but I seriously doubt you are even reading this.


I downloaded this and it isn't working
======================================
Well, this is a *dead* project, and it was created using Zend (1.8 until 1.12 (?)).
There is a new Zend version that I believe is quite different to this, so just go there and learn the new framework !
If you really want this thing to make it work
Copy all the contents of extra outside the apmgr folder and name it library (or whatever I was using as the library folder)
Copy the index.php located on extra into the folder public_html_apmgr, that is outside the apmgr folder too.

Is really not working
=====================
Well, like I said, I haven't touch this for 2 years and I don't even know if I'm using the real sources.
The real application is on my FreeBSD box but the apache virtual is down, since this is a project I do 
not longer use
