What was Apmgr?
===============

Apmgr was a real estate application written in PHP, using Zend Framework.
It was the year 2008, and I felt like I needed to start playing with Php Frameworks more seriously.
I tried for a bit Zend, but I found it a bit difficult, I tested another frameworks but they were
just awful.

Long story short, a year went by, and I decided to join efforts with another developer and create our own application and sell it.

Well, writting the application, learning the framework, was a difficult task, mostly because I had to work and so did she.

Also having a life was somewhat troublesome for the whole energy required to do this kind of thing.

You will find several tools that I used here, mostly handmade, from regular shellscripts, there must be something
that can be rehused here and there, I guess. I haven't touch this since 2011.

TL;DR;
It just didn't work out, she didn't knew at all how to sell the product (or actually wanted to go on with this), and I was an insistent asshole.
So it just didn't work.
